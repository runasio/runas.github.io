# RunAs GitHub.io Webpage

This is our research and our data about social network
automation. This page will also describe what we do and what we want.

RunAs wants to share with all the community our research and studies
about social network. We decided to split our (continuous) work in
different parts.

## Libraries

Social Network can be remotely controlled by private or public
libraries, with or without official support. Automatizing social
network need to look around and try to understand the common pattern
used by all actors. We will collect information about all projects who
want to automatize one or many social network. Here the information we
will try to find:

 * name: a string() containing the name of the project.
 
 * official: a boolean() to define if this project is an official one
   maintained by the creators of the social networks.
 
 * language: programming language used to make the library or the
   tool.
 
 * links: information about the libraries like documentation or
   official website.
 
 * sources: a list of url containing project's source code.
 
 * contributors: a list containing contributor's names and
   information.
 
 * version: the current version.
 
 * create-date: when the project was made.
 
 * last-release: the last deployed release of the library or the tool.
 
 * notes: some note about the project.

This is a flexible database and we can add more information about each
project. Those data are stored in JSON and can be easily modified by
github PR.

## Studies

That our researches about all social network, and how things works. It
will be in markdown format at first and maybe in a more professional
format later.

## Papers

A list of reviewed papers on our subject. Like libraries, it is mainly
a flexible database in JSON format.
